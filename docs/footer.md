## Example Implementation
A complete example implementation of this module can be found in the [example directory](https://github.com/kunduso/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/main/example). The example demonstrates how to:

- Set up the AWS provider
- Configure the VPC module
- Define required variables
- Set up backend configuration

You can use this example as a reference for implementing the module in your own infrastructure code.
</br> Additionally, the repository includes [Azure Pipelines](https://github.com/kunduso/terraform-aws-vpc/blob/main/pipeline/azure-pipelines.yaml) to automate the deployment of this infrastructure as part of a CI/CD pipeline. This makes it easy to apply your Terraform configurations directly from the pipeline.

Note: Ensure you have appropriate AWS credentials configured before running the example.
